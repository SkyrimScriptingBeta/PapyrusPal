Use strongly typed code, even in dynamic languages like Python.
Make the code as strictly typed as possible, types for all parameters and return values of functions, etc. But you should also take advantage of type inference, so do not add types where type inference would work. Use `var` and `auto` in C#/C++ etc for type inference. Avoid `any` and `Any` or `Unknown` types in Python and TypeScript etc, when possible. And prefer strong types over dictionaries and maps. So instead of making a dict[str,int] you should consider if having a struct (C++) or @dataclass/Pydantic BaseModel (Python) or interface (TypeScript) etc would help make the code more clean and 

Please note that whenever you trigger a code "save", my editor might auto-format the code. This might include moving functions/imports around to rearrange them. And it might remove unused imports. So just be warned and know this. If you add imports, then save, the imports might be removed. So add the code that uses the imports first.
